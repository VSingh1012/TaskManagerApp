This is my take on a basic task-manager app, called "Productivity-Go!"

Its friendly navigation and relaxed UI allows for easy management of reminders and tasks without the struggle of unfamiliar features!

Its features include: 

- **Adding tasks**: The user can simply press the "Add" button after typing in a task and an optional description.
- **Animated Effects** : Simple animations for the buttons and tasks are used to enhance the user experience.
- **Deleting tasks**: The red "X" is present at the end of every task if the user decides they don't need it anymore.
- **Color-coding tasks based on priority**: The dropdown menu right before the task input includes three colors indicative of priority of the task, from yellow being lowest in priority, to red being the highest.
- **Timestamps of the dates**: A helpful feature for the user to track when they assigned and completed tasks embedded in each task.
- **Settings**: For if the user feels they need a change of fonts or themes, they can click the gear in the top right to head to the settings.
- **Themes & fonts**: If the user feels they need a change of setting and/or font text, they can access the 4 different themes and fonts in the Settings menu and select at their leisure.

**External Libraries**: The only library I imported externally was **date-fns**, from which I used its format function to collect the dates for the large title, as well as for the date completed and date assigned for the ongoing/completed reminders.

Everything else I used was directly from react or react-native.

Thank you Chapter-One for this opportunity! I hope you enjoy the application.
