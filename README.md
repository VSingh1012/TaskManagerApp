This is my take on a basic task-manager app, called "Productivity-Go!"

Its friendly navigation and relaxed UI allows for easy management of reminders and tasks without the struggle of unfamiliar features!

Its features include: 

- Adding tasks : The user can simply press the "Add" button after typing in a task and an optional description
- Deleting tasks : The red "X" is present at the end of every task if the user decides they don't need it anymore
- Color-coding tasks based on priority : The dropdown menu right before the task input includes three colors indicative of priority of the task, from yellow being lowest in priority, to red being the highest
- Timestamps of the dates : A helpful feature for the user to track when they assigned and completed tasks embedded in each task
- Settings : For if the user feels they need a change of fonts or themes, they can click the gear in the top right to head to the settings.
- Themes & fonts : If the user feels they need a change of setting and/or font text, they can access the 4 different themes and fonts int the Settings menu and select at their leisure.

Thank you Chapter-One for this opportunity! I hope you enjoy the application.
